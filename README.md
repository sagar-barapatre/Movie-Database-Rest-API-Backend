# ### [Movie-Database-Rest-API-Backend](https://github.com/sagar-barapatre/Movie-Database-Rest-API-Backend)
## üìå Problem Statement

To build an Rest API server like IMDB, where,
‚óè public users can use the service to search for movies by name, genre and be able to sort and filter the results by votes, genre
‚óè Registered/Authenticated users should be able to add movies, upVote/downVote
movies, set favourite genre and get recommendations based on favourite genre.

### üåê Live Project - https://movie-database-rest-api.herokuapp.com

### Front-End - EJS + Bootstrap

### Back-End - Node.js(Express.js) & MongoDB(mongoose)

## Tech Stack

### Front-end

-   The front-end client is built as a simple-page-application using EJS
-   Bootstrap 4 is used for page styling.

### Back-end

-   The back-end server is built with Express.js and Node.js in MVC pattern, which provides completed REST APIs for data interaction.
-   Passport.js is used as an authentication middleware in the sever.
-   JSON Web Token (JWT) is used for signing in user and making authenticated requests.

### Database

-   MongoDB is used as the back-end database, which include different data models/schemas (i.e., User, Post and Comment).
-   Mongoose is used to access the MongoDB for CRUD actions (create, read, update and delete).

## Registration Services

‚óè Register/Signup - API for user registration (username/password should be fine)
‚óè Login API - Registered user should be able to login and use other API's

## Services that can be used by registered users only:
‚óè Add Movies API - A registered user is able to add a movie to the DB. A movie does have a name, genre, release date, up-votes, down-votes and reviews.
‚óè Set favourite genre API - A registered user is able to set their favourite genre.
‚óè Get Movie Detail API - A registered user is able get all the details about a movie (name, genre, release date, up-votes, down-votes and reviews)
‚óè UpVote/DownVote API - A registered user is able to upvote or down-vote a movie.
‚óè Add Review API - A registered user is able to add a review for a movie.

## ‚≠ê How to get started on local system?

1. Clone the Repo by going to your local Git Client and pushing in the command:
git clone https://github.com/sagar-barapatre/Movie-Database-Rest-API-Backend.git
2. Now, push in the command under `Movie-Database-Rest-API-Backend` directory which will install all the dependencies of the project:
`npm install`
3. Make sure you have  `npm`  Node.js installed in your system. MongoAtlas is used, so no need for local MongoDB setup.
4.  MongoAtlas Setup  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M&feature=youtu.be&t=293](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M&feature=youtu.be&t=293)  
5. Set up your `.env` file and paste in the URI that you get from following the instructions in the video above. Also set token secret to anything, it is used for jwt authentication.
	```
	PORT=2001
	DB_CONNECTION=**your MongoURI**
	EXPRESS_SESSION_SECRET=**your secret key**
	```
	You need to remember to paste in the and . Do NOT share it publicly, and do NOT include the .env file in commits.

6.  [Only once] Run (from the main directory)  `npm run dev` 

7.  Go to  `https://localhost:2001`  to see the application running.
